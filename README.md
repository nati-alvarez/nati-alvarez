# Welcome, I'm Natividad
#### Full-stack Web Dev and JavaScript Enthusiast

### About me
I've been coding for about 4-5ish years now (since I was a junior in high school.) What inspires me to get up every day and boot up the text editor
is creating cool projects that are fun to develop or projects that make a real impact on people. I Love working with full-stack JS but very open to learning more tech. Currently seeking full-time remote opportunities!

### What are you working on?
Right now, I'm working on a platform I have big plans for. I call it, CodeCompanions! In the beginning, as a junior self-taught dev, I struggled to get real collaborative experience on a dev team. People I reached out to in various communities ghosted me after one day, internship applications weren't getting replies, etc. So I've set out to create a platform just for that! Developers will be able to meet and collaborate with other devs on awesome passion projects! It'll be the one-stop development shop, from getting people onboard to planning, writing, and reviewing code.
